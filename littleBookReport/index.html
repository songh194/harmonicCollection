        <h3>This book consists of a collection of photographs taken at a per memorial park in LA. 
            Containing 16 pages, it is horizontally long, and binded with staples. All the pages have
            the same tone of blue as the color, binding the concept of the whole book together. 
            <br><br>
            The first spread and the last page have this same screen-like texture with the pictures 
            of the park, which seperates them from the rest of the content, which are pictures of 
            headstones of the pets in the park. The simple similarities of the structures define 
            what they are. 
            <br><br>
            I quite like this book, because it showcases this simple collection in a unique way,
            where you can focus on the content. It does also trigger the emotions of the viewers
            with the content, because the headstones make you imagine what kind of life the pets 
            and the families might have had.
